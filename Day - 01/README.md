Problem Statement:
We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:
Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).

Logic I used:
as it's output is one I used Behavioral model and assigned output as 1'b0
