📌Problem Statement 1:

Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:

a -> w

b -> x

b -> y

c -> z

Logic I Used:

As there are 4 outputs and 3 inputs , I assigned each output to the particular input according to the problem statement.

📌Problem Statement 2:

Create a module that implements a NOT gate.
This circuit is similar to wire, but with a slight difference. When making the connection from the wire in to the wire out we're 
going to implement an inverter (or "NOT-gate") instead of a plain wire.

Logic I Used:

As the output is opposite to the input , I made nagation(~) to the input and assigned it to the output.
